Elevator-use algorithm:
1. Ask human for input on destination floor.
2. record whether destination floor is up/down relative to current
floor.
3. Until destination floor is reached, do the following:
  -Ascend/Descend 1 floor depending on record from step (2)
  -Check whether anyone has called the elevator at current floor
  -If so, stop, open doors, and let them board. If not, proceed up/down
  -If new passangers select intermediary floors, mark them
  for stopping on the way to original destination floor
4. Arrive at destination floor and open doors to release passengers

Human-behavior algorithm - finding a solution for a problem
while coding.

1. Visit Google.com and input search terms for question
2. Scan first search result (usually Stack Overflow) for
relevant information
3. If suitable solution is found, celebrate and continue coding
If no solution is found, return to google
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3, for several subsequent search results
5. after about 5 failed attempts, rephrase search query with new
wording and try again from step 1.
